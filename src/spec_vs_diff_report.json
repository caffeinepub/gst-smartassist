  "summary": "The diff implements substantial fixes for TypeScript errors, Motoko compilation issues, React Query hooks, enum mappings, localStorage error handling, and date handling. Most requirements appear to have been addressed with evidence across multiple files. However, some requirements lack clear evidence of complete implementation in the truncated diff.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-22",
      "requirement": "Ensure frontend routing configuration in App.tsx has no circular dependencies, all route paths are unique, and lazy-loaded components are properly wrapped in error boundaries",
      "reason": "While App.tsx shows lazy-loaded components with Suspense fallback, there is no evidence of error boundaries wrapping the lazy-loaded components or route components to catch component-level errors",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/App.tsx"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-26",
      "requirement": "Add proper error boundaries around critical UI sections to prevent entire app crashes from component-level errors, and implement fallback UI for error states",
      "reason": "No ErrorBoundary component implementation or usage is visible in the diff. The requirement explicitly calls for error boundaries around critical sections, but only Suspense boundaries are present",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/App.tsx"
